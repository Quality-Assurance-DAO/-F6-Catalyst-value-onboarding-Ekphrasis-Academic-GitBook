## Detailed plan

### Background

The Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook records the activities of the Catalyst-Swarm which formed in April 2021 out of the Project Catalyst experiment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Proposal

The aim of this proposal is to fund maintenance of the Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook from November 2021 to January 2022. This assumes a single maintainer who collates materials relevant to Swarm and tracks daily activities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Relevant experience (identifying information)

Stephen Whitenstall has 30 years' experience in organizing academic, community and business projects. He develops, maintains documentation and provides technical project management support for Catalyst Swarm.

In Fund 5 of Project Catalyst Stephen's QA-DAO (https://stephen-rowan.gitbook.io/quality-assurance-dao/) submitted a proposal "Quality Assurance DAO" in the Developer Ecosystem Challenge that was funded in August 2021.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ### Sustainability

QA-DAO (https://stephen-rowan.gitbook.io/quality-assurance-dao/) and Catalyst-Swarm are seeking GitHub sponsorship ( https://github.com/sponsors/Quality-Assurance-DAO) and will also explore StakePool Operator sponsorship. The aim being to become independent of Project Catalyst funding. As it takes time to build up sufficient sponsorship - this proposal seeks to fill the gap.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Maintenance

Whilst the Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook content is open-source the maintenance is currently the work of @swhitenstall. The reason for this is the organizational overhead involved in sharing the maintainer role and soliciting and reviewing submissions from the community.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Roadmap (Definition of success after 3, 6 and 12 months)

Prior to funding

Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis - July 2021 to September 2021 ongoing

3 months

Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis - October 2021 to December 2021

Once funded Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis will aim to communicate its documentation and tracking via social media to reach a wider audience. Sponsorships are being sought.

6 months

Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis - January 2022 to March 2022

In the medium term Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis aims to be self-sustaining and sponsorships will help achieve this aim.

12 months

Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis - April 2022 to September 2022

In the long term Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis should be self-sustaining and sponsorships will help achieve this aim.
