## Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details

## Background

The Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook records the activities of the Catalyst-Swarm which formed in April 2021 out of the Project Catalyst experiment.

## Proposal

The aim of this proposal is to fund maintenance of the Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook from November 2021 to January 2022. This assumes a single maintainer who collates materials relevant to Swarm and tracks daily activities.

## Sustainability

QA-DAO (https://stephen-rowan.gitbook.io/quality-assurance-dao/) and Catalyst-Swarm are seeking GitHub sponsorship ( https://github.com/sponsors/Quality-Assurance-DAO)) and will also explore StakePool Operator sponsorship. The aim being to become independent of Project Catalyst funding. As it takes time to build up sufficient sponsorship - this proposal seeks to fill the gap.

## Maintenance

Whilst the Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook content is open-source the maintenance is currently restricted. The reason for this is the organizational overhead involved in sharing the maintainer role and soliciting and reviewing submissions from the community.

## Budget

Regular updates over 3 months (21 hours per month) to add content

$40 per hour for 63 hours (21 x 3) = $ 2540

Total: $ 2540
