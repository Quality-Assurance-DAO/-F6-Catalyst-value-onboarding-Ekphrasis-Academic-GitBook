## Detailed plan

### The Solution - providing a context to Catalyst-Swarm

The Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook has been recording the activities of the Catalyst-Swarm from its formation in April 2021.

The evolution of Catalyst-Swarm from Swarm sessions in April 2021 ( https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-swarm-genesis/april-2021/swarm-sessions ) through organizing After Town Halls from June 2021 ( https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-swarm-genesis/june-2021/after-town-hall#june-16th-town-hall ) to hosting Idea Fest in July 2021 ( https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-swarm-genesis/july-2021/catalyst-idea-fest-july-2021 ) is all documented in the Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook.

The GitBook provides a useful reference tool for anyone interested in Catalyst-Swarm and its development and a valuable context for a community emerging out of the Project Catalyst experiment.  Catalyst Town Hall videos and slides are embedded alongside related After Town Hall "open space" events and activities. A summary of voting results for Fund 4 and 5 is included to provide further context.

In addition details of Catalyst-Swarm's evolving organization are documented in a governance section ( https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-swarm-genesis/governance/overview ). This aims to provide transparency and accountability to the community that Catalyst-Swarm supports.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ### Sustainability

QA-DAO (https://stephen-rowan.gitbook.io/quality-assurance-dao/) and Catalyst-Swarm are seeking GitHub sponsorship ( https://github.com/sponsors/Quality-Assurance-DAO) and will also explore StakePool Operator sponsorship. The aim being to become independent of Project Catalyst funding. As it takes time to build up sufficient sponsorship - this proposal seeks to fill the gap.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Maintenance

Whilst the Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook content is open-source the maintenance is currently the work of @swhitenstall. The reason for this is the organizational overhead involved in sharing the maintainer role and soliciting and reviewing submissions from the community.
