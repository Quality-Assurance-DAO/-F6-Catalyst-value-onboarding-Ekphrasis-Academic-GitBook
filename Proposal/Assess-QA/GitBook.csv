F6: Catalyst value onboarding,Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook,http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBnTS,z_assessor_309,309-369556,369556,"The proposal fits well in challenge settings (A sense of community and conversations), and the project is having a vibrating impact on Cardano community already. 

The key metrics and goals of the proposal align with the outlined challenge settings and the proposal is able to address future challenges. 
",5,"An ongoing viable project needs funding for a 3 months maintenance period and the working plan is very well articulated. 

The budget is realistically outlined and broken down into identifiable items and is reasonable to achieve the set goal. 

No risk is associated with the solution, but for that type of activity and for its necessary timeframe it is unlikely that something (impactful) may occur to alter the state of this phase of project.",4,"It is highly likely that the proposal will succed as is well articulated as a working plan, has its roadmap defined with milestones and a time horizon for achievement, and the given experience of the proposer. 

Metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal are set."
F6: Catalyst value onboarding,Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook,http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBnTS,z_assessor_43,43-369556,369556,"The problem and solution are reasonable and within the scope of the challenge. 

Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook is a repository of important information about Catalyst Swarm and Catalyst. The maintenance and curation of live sessions and information about Catalyst allows for a channel of aggregation and redirection of the community, important aspects to educate and inform the community, which consequently helps to maintain cohesion and mitigate information fragmentation, providing a channel where people can learn about Catalyst and know where to look for more information. Gitbook maintenance also allows for asynchronous communication, enabling the community to access content from previous sessions in the future. 

No metrics/KPIs related to the material to be cataloged were presented, which I consider important for impact assessment. I would recommend establishing some targets for the amount of material to be archived.",4,"The proposer has been carrying out the work voluntarily for a few months and by looking at the Gitbook it is possible to check the quality of the work developed. There are details about the proposer's qualifications and experience (with sources to check) indicating ability to execute the proposal. 

There is a reasonable and adequate plan for maintaining the repository for a period of 3 months. A budget breakdown was presented and the values defined are reasonable.",5,"There is clarity in the problem, solution and their relationship to the challenge. 

The roadmap has a temporary line of 12 months, and the fundind will be allocated to the next three months of maintenance, the proposer will look for alternative funding on the following months. 

The cataloged material is public, so it is easy to check what is being carried out. Metrics/KPIs were not established that would allow the proposal to be audited in an objective way. I would recommend including targets for the files/content to be added to Gitbook."

F6: Catalyst value onboarding,Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook,http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBnTS,z_assessor_45,45-369556,369556,"Trying to make sense of Catalyst is an almost impossible task with multiple channels and resources available (especially for newbies). As a Catalysts participant for several months i have seen Swarm starting to establish into a dependable hub. As such this proposal will help add value to the community and is worth funding. 

The piece i would have liked to have seen in this proposal is how the GitHub and Swarm aligns with the catalyst circle, IOG you tube channel and the catalyst community site (dev.projectcatalyst.org) along with others. There is some duplication of content (eg TH slides). As part of the marketing it would be good to how Swarm differentiates itself and the boundaries within which it works.",5,"I have validated the time estimates for maintenance and marketing with someone who does this for a living and they both make sense. 
As Stephen has been doing the maintenance it is reasonable to expect he will continue. 
The budget also seems sensible for this type of work. My reference point for this employment of freelance staff to conduct both admin and social media marketing roles on project i have run.",5,"A set of targets to define success is missing. 
eg. 
- x link through from social media to gitbook 
- no of visits to gitbook 
- no of new attendees to swarm sessions - referred via the marketing campaign 

the risks should also be called out. There are 2 i see that require mitigation: 
1. Stephen is no longer able to maintain the gitbook or drive the social media updates 
2. sponsorship is not forthcoming in the next few months - do this work stop or will the proposer come back for further interim funding?"
F6: Catalyst value onboarding,Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook,http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBnTS,z_assessor_54,54-369556,369556,"We really need a section for ""additional funding"" for previously funded proposals. Even though I completely understand why the proposer requires additional funding, it is not related to the challenge DIRECTLY. 

Anyway, the idea of such a working site is definitely with the alignment of the challenge, this proposal is asking for covering the maintenance.",4,"they can deliver the product, cause it is running.",5,"marketing + maintenance records. Can be audited. 

Success = already running...so....what to measure."
F6: Catalyst value onboarding,Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook,http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBnTS,z_assessor_540,540-369556,369556,"A useful proposal, to sustain and fund important work that is already being done. Having somewhere that newcomers can find a record of Swarm activities, meetings etc, helps with meaningful onboarding, as it directly addresses the challenge question about how newcomers find out about Catalyst. It also reassures newcomers about accountability and set standards for transparency; these things have a quiet but significant impact on building Catalyst's culture, and enabling people to contribute. 
It is also positive that the proposal includes ideas for sustaining itself beyond this funding round. 
",5,"The work is already being done successfully, so there is little doubt that it can continue to be implemented successfully. The budget is clear and realistic, and the roadmap makes sense. The only new thing being done with the funding is addressing marketing and publicity; this is clearly feasible within the budget and timescale, although it would be good to have a bit more detail on specific marketing plans. For example, which social media accounts will be used, who do they reach, and how will posts be targeted towards newcomers so as to address key elements of the challenge setting?",4,"There is essentially enough information to audit success - the bulk of the work is auditable via looking at the gitbook itself. But auditability info on marketing could be improved a little. I would have liked to see the proposal establish what metrics it plans to look at to assess marketing success – will it be number of engagements on social media platforms/Discord etc, or will it be how far those engagements actually drive people to the gitbook? - and perhaps to set some broad marketing targets."
F6: Catalyst value onboarding,Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook,http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBnTS,z_assessor_66,66-369556,369556,This proposal effectively addresses the challenge. The goal of onboarding more people into catalyst is a necessary step to its success. The amount of information that is created weekly requires a clear and common place which can be accessed by all users. Having the Gitbook will serve as a key place for new comers to catalyst and will also be invaluable as catalyst grows to new heights. The ability to track our growth in a way that is accessible will be pivotal to continued growth.,5,"Given the experience and plan presented it is extremely likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. Stephen has been a key player in the catalyst swarm sessions and has been providing much of his time for free to date. His participation in the swarm meetings and the follow up work behind the scenes is a testament to his willingness to continue this work on his own. The plan presented is clear, well laid out, and shows that a lot of thought has already gone into this. The links provided by the proposer also strengthen it overall by providing additional information, however the proposal itself is strong as a stand alone for voters who may not have the time/will to look at all the links. 
In addition, the budget being requested seems more than fair for this work and doesn't capture free work he has already put in.",5,"The reason I am not giving this criteria a 5 is because I would like to see more information at each of the milestones. For example, the proposer highlights that sustainability is a key component of this work and that sponsorships are being sought, but I think more information could be provided here. What type of sponsorships? Would the idea to have others eventually do the Gitbook? There is also no real contingency should something happen to the one proposer. If say he gets sick, or something happens that pulls him away, what will happen? While I do think the proposal does allow for auditing the progress and success, some additional thinking on the points raised here will strengthen the possibility of overall success. Still, great work and looking forward to the outcome."
